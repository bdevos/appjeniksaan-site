In the 2021 battle for the web, who is the bad guy? Google or Apple, both, neither? I really enjoyed this take by [@ppk](https://twitter.com/ppk).

Personally I am really grateful for everybody at Chrome getting us to this place, but a lot of new features of the recent years haven't been all that exiting to me. Where will we go, we'll see ðŸ‘€.
