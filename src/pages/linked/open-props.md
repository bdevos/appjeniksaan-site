Wanted to play around with Open Props from [@argyleink](https://twitter.com/argyleink) in combination with the new [Astro](https://astro.build) setup.

Open Props provides a lot of CSS variables to make it easier to standardise the styling on any website. It was a bit of work getting everything to work the way I wanted with Astro, but I think it has simplefied the CSS quite a bit.

I also decided to use the `normalize` styles from Open Props. This does make the site look a lot like an Open Props styled website. So I will have to see if I keep that part.
