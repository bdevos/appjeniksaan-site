Adding a `ScrollView` in SwiftUI is really simple, but that simplicity comes with some limitations. [This article](https://swiftwithmajid.com/2020/09/24/mastering-scrollview-in-swiftui/) from [Swift with Majid](https://swiftwithmajid.com) helped me understand how you can track the current offset in a `ScrollView` with a `PreferenceKey`.

For more information about using `PreferenceKey`, [Swift with Majid](https://swiftwithmajid.com) has you covered with the article: [The magic of view preferences in SwiftUI](https://swiftwithmajid.com/2020/01/15/the-magic-of-view-preferences-in-swiftui/)
