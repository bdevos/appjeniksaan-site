Over the past couple of years, I have moved away from using reader apps and now consume most of my tech news through newsletters. This new method of consuming content feels more relaxed and puts a dedicated mailbox at the center of the experience. However, there were a few exceptions, and one of them was reading updates from [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net) through my Twitter feed. But with the recent Twitter situation ðŸ’©, I have been avoiding it more and more, but sometimes feel I am missing out.

I almost installed a RSS reader app again, but I know that I would just end up with another content consumption addiction. I found a couple of services that can also mail these updates, which sounds more like what I was looking for.

But then I discovered the [react-email](https://github.com/resendlabs/react-email) project last week. It describes itself as "The next generation of writing emails - High-quality, unstyled components for creating emails." So, I thought why not write my own RSS to email service. At first, I wanted to keep it as a private repository, but by making it public, my own setup can be easily cloned or forked into a personalized system that anyone can use.

Without further ado, introducing: [RSS to Email](https://github.com/bdevos/rss-to-email).
