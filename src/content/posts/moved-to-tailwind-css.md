To gain additional experience with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), I wanted to test its compatibility with Astro. The pairing may seem odd as the Markdown converted content doesn't have any classes for styling. This results in a significant amount of `@apply` logic in the [stylesheet](https://github.com/bdevos/appjeniksaan-site/blob/267166633c973a322c9a1ac0954edf309a7f79eb/src/styles/main.css). Despite this, I am satisfied with the outcome.
