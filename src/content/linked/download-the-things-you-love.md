I whole heartedly agree with Matt that you should download the things you love, but I think you should ask the question raised long ago by Haddaway: ["What Is Love"](https://youtu.be/HEXWRTEbj1I).

When you are convinced that you will want to listen to that old podcast series in 10 years time, sure have fun and download it. But I think you should be mindfull that most of this stuff is better in your memory than it is listening back to it. Every once in a while I'm confronted with something that I liked in the past, but has been lost from the internet. I have accepted that this is the way it is. Same goes for music and movies when they are not on the streaming services, they are gone. If they are brougth back in the future, then I would love to get back to them. But if not, that's OK too. I think you should pick careful what you deem important, because those picked things deserve to be special.
