> This is the best-kept secret of the software engineering profession: engineers hate code. Especially code written by other people. It's why they love working on greenfield projects so much. No code, no maintenance, no headaches!

There is little I have to add to this linked post: software engineers hate code, whether it's old code, recent code where somebody attempted something overly clever, code that hasn't been updated in a while, or code that has been recently updated by someone who didn't fully grasp the entire context. They hate it all. Great post.
