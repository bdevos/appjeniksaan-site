A couple of years ago, the major browser vendors started [Interop](https://web.dev/interop-2023/), a project aimed at aligning the features to be introduced on the web.

At Google I/O 2023, they are now introducing [Baseline](https://web.dev/baseline/), which will hopefully ðŸ¤ž make it easier to determine the functionality you can start using in your web projects.

I really appreciate their efforts to create more clarity. Currently, I still rely on [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com) to make these decisions. However, it would be great to have a simple way of knowing if a new library has the same support as you want to offer to your users.

What has been concerning to see is how Firefox appears to be falling behind in implementing new features. While Safari used to be the browser holding back progress on the web, Mozilla seems to have taken over that position and Safari has really picked up the pace.
