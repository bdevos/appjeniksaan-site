When I am procastinating, my mind is searching for motivation. But as [Zbyhnev](https://www.wisdomination.com/screw-motivation-what-you-need-is-discipline/) describes, focussing on discipline makes a lot more sense. Start with something small and continue â™º with taking small incremental steps. The process will get you a lot further than trying to get something done in big bursts. It sounds very obvious, but I make this mistake all the time.

> Discipline, in short, is a system, whereas motivation is analogous to goals. There is a symmetry. Discipline is more or less self-perpetuating and constant, whereas motivation is a bursty kind of thing.
