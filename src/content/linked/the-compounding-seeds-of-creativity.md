> Early on in my career, I learned a very important lesson about creativity: It canâ€™t be saved for later. Creativity is perishable, just like inspiration. It has to be discharged regularly or it will spoil. And if you let enough of it go to waste, eventually your talents will sour and shrivel with it.

This take from DHH really resonates with my personal experience. You might feel that you should be able to ignore some of the boring day-to-day tasks and switch on creative mode right after, but the mundane bits seem to have quite the effect on the rest. I do find it difficult to avoid this sometimes, but the best way seems to be to not get stuck on failure and just try again.
