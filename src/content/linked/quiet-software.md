Really vibe with [this post](https://blog.mikeswanson.com/backseat-software/) from [Mike Swanson](https://blog.mikeswanson.com). In the post Mike goes into some of the history and motivations why software has become so obnoxious and why the *problem* has become so wide spread. His term for software that stays away from this trend is backseat software, I like to think of it as quiet software.

> I've started to think of this as **backseat software**: the slow shift from software as a tool you operate to software as a channel that operates on you. Once a product learns it can talk back, it's remarkably hard to keep it quiet.

One of the comments below the post nails, in my view, the reason: advertising. Not just in the sense of promoting the product directly, but promoting either a feature or the users action resulting in the product being promoted. 

Everytime I get the popup to ask for a review, I feel that they are not at all interested in my opinion, but the only reason for me to review is that it will help with App Store ranking.

I see no quick or easy solution to getting back to software that is more quiet. If anything, I think for the next couple of years with vibe coded apps it will only get worse.

But I really like this concept and I will try to keep my software as quiet as I can.
