This post got me thinking about the paradox of writing "good" code. If the code is truly well-written, it will likely be read very rarely. In contrast, poorly written code needs constant tweaking and, therefore, ends up being read a lot.

As developers, our best course of action is probably to strive for maximum readability in our code, with the hope that the code and the logic it embodies will seldom need to be read in the future.
