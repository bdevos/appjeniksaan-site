> I realized that when I think that something is 'weird,' it is not really about what I think at all. What I am actually doing is modeling what I think other people will think about it.

This sentiment really rhymes with my feelings, a lot of decisions we make are based on what we think is expected of us. Push the boundaries a bit by going for the weird.
