> [â€¦] understanding that all of our mantras need to be understood as proverbs and not laws.

This post aligns well with the way I think about programming mantras. I see a lot of developers applying a good idea to everything and thereby losing sight of its intent. Considering them as proverbs that can be applied to a specific situation, but should only be used as guidance seems like a healthier way of following their advice.
