Last weekend, I got kicked out of YouTube for using an ad blocker. At first, it seemed tempting to disable the blocking and get back to the entertainment, but perhaps this is just a good incentive to not spend my time watching videos. In this linked ["Splitting the Web"](https://ploum.net/2023-08-01-splitting-the-web.html) post, [Ploum](https://ploum.net) argues that the web is splitting in two directions, and I fully agree. The commercial direction is becoming increasingly egregious in its use of your data and attention, turning you into the product. The other direction appears to be comprised of individuals concerned about what is happening to the web.

When my ad blocker interferes with a website or a site requires me to turn it off, I simply leave. If the content was worthwhile, it will likely appear elsewhere. The frustrating aspect of this situation is that the direction I despise seems to be the more successful strategy and is therefore becoming increasingly popular.
