Making software is an enjoyable path of discovery ðŸš€. This is my personal software development shop to let me build things that I think are interesting or just fun to create.

## Technology

Developers tend to get sucked into hype driven development. New frameworks and libraries come around so frequently and new and shiny âœ¨ is just so much fun to play ðŸ•¹ with. That is why I like to develop personal project with new technology and get to know the pros and cons before recommending a larger customer to commit to technology that they will need to support for the foreseeable future.

Because modern software is both back-end and front-end working in unison I develop both. For the last couple of years I have been primary focussed on React development. But who knows what the future will hold ðŸ”®.

## The name?

The name appjeniksaan is based on the dutch sentence "heb je niks aan" and loosely translates to "useless app" ðŸ˜‰
